# 2019_STMhero

## Overview

This projec is mostly based on the idea of Guitar Hero and is based on two parts:
- the guitar itself along with its software
- desktop Python-based application

### The hardware

We used photoresistors to create an imitation of strings and buttons to trigger a proper line in the destop app. Dragging was based on an accelerometer. We used:

- STM32CubeMX
- SystemWorkbench for STM32 environment
- STM32F407 board
